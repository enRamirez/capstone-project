First toggle will give the user a choice between strecthes or muscle strengthing

I do have an api for workouts of varies difficulties and/or equipment requirements. 
    All of which will have toggles to lessen the search results such as;
        - dumbbells (toggle have, dont have)
        - barbells (toggle have, dont have)
        - weight bar (toggle have, dont have)

    Once the equipment toggles are set by the user, then the user can search more accurately to their needs.

After the user has selected their desired body part of focus then the page will be directed to videos or diagrams of such workouts.

Accunt free users will be able to view everything on the website but if they made an account then they will be able to add liked videos to their favorites for future uses.
